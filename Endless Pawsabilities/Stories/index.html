			<p class="ParaText">Max is the most American dog you can get. Born into an impoverished family in Canda, Max was able to cross the border into America after being captured by dog capturers. He lived a difficult life, but always kept up his indominable spirit. Eventually, an owner decided to adaopt Max. Fun, loving, and an insatiable appetite for fun and games, Max truly is the quinsisential part of American Dogs.</p>
			  <p class="ParaText">Max also has had a loving owner. His favorite snacks are chicken, and a treats. His previous owners allowed Max to hunt, but recently, he has not caught any live prey. Maybe it is due to his new owners kindess and love. Max still loves to hang out with his family and enjoys things. It will be interesting to see what becomes of Max in the near future. Max was also one of the first pets donated for Endless Pawsabilities. </p>

She has tried her hardest to fit in, but has also been trying to figure out different emotional values. Thanks to Endless Pawsabiliteis, she has been able to find ways of making things work for her. Kitty is in a much better place with her new owners. </p>

Her previous owners forbade her from leaving her home. Her new owners are the opposite, for Kitty is allowed to run around and do things she could have only dreampy of with her previous owners. </p>

Thanks to Endless Pawsabilites, she now has a more permanent, more loving home. Long term, she hopes to be able to fill out more information with whatever it is that she is meant to be doing.</p>
			  <p class="ParaText">Ronald's favorite hobbies include talking like a pirate, and bobbing her head up and down. Her owners love her for who she is, and loves to always entertain her. Ronald is a lot happier with her new owners than her previous owners. Endless Pawsabilities has changed her life for the better, and enabled a much happy, healtheir bird. Recently, Ronald has also begun to sing, which is something she has never been able to do. Maybe it is due to her new owner's hospitality and their ability to make Ronald happy.</p>
